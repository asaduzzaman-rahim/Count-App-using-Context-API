# React Counter App (Context API)

## Overview
This is a simple React Counter Application built using the **Context API**.  
The app demonstrates global state management by sharing `count` and `theme (color)` state across multiple components without prop drilling.  
It also includes a light/dark mode toggle using a bulb icon for better UI experience.
